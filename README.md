# API REST for an Airbnb Clone

## Project Description

This was a project built during a full-stack software development bootcamp. The goal was to set up a REST API to learn Node.js and backend technologies.

We also built a React Frontend for the project, which is a lookalike of the AirBnB site. You can find it in this repo: [AirBnB Clone React](https://github.com/jgarciagalvez/AirBnB-clone-react)

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- bcrypt
- PostgreSQL
- Dotenv (Enviroment configuration and deployment)
- Postman

## Features

- _User Authentication:_ Secure endpoints that handle user registration, login, authentication and access control.
- _Property Management:_ RESTful API routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) property listings.
- _Booking System:_ Endpoints to handle booking transactions.
- _Advanced Filtering:_ Query parameters to allow clients to request listings based on various filters such as location, price range, custom search, etc.
- _Reviews and Ratings:_ API functionality to post reviews, calculate average star ratings for properties, and retrieve reviews for display on the frontend.

## Original Repo

This is a fork from the [original repo](https://github.com/haikuacademy/B11G05-airbnb-api) where all team members contributed to build the app. I forked the repo so I could continue work and optimise a few things
